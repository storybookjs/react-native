  <h1>Welcome to Storybook for HTML</h1>
  <p>This is a UI component dev environment for your plain HTML snippets.</p>
  <p>
    We've added some basic stories inside the <code class="code">stories</code> directory.
    <br />
    A story is a single state of one or more UI components. You can have as many stories as you want.
    <br />
    (Basically a story is like a visual test case.)
  </p>
  <p>
    See these sample <a class="link" href="#" data-sb-kind="Demo" data-sb-story="button">stories</a>
  </p>
  <p><img src=logo.svg class="logo" /></p>
  <p>
    Just like that, you can add your own snippets as stories.
    <br />
    You can also edit those snippets and see changes right away.
    <br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Usually we create stories with smaller UI components in the app.<br />
