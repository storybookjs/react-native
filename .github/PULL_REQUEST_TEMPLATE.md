## What I did

## How to test

Please explain how to test your changes and consider the following questions

- Does this need a new example in examples/native?
- Does this need an update to the documentation?

If your answer is yes to any of these, please make sure to include it in your PR.

<!--

Everybody: Please submit all PRs to the `next-6.0` branch unless they are specific to 5.3. Storybook maintainers cherry-pick bug and documentation fixes into the `master` branch as part of the release process, so you shouldn't need to worry about this.

Maintainers: Please tag your pull request with at least one of the following:
`["cleanup", "BREAKING CHANGE", "feature request", "bug", "documentation", "maintenance", "dependencies", "other"]`
