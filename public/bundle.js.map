It’s a Notes addon on which you can display some notes for a story.</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Just for the simplicity, we’ll write the addon right inside our app. But we can easily move it into a separate NPM module.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<h2>How it looks</h2>\\n<p>We write a story for our addon like this:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-js\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">import</span> React <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">from</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'react'</span>;\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">import</span> { storiesOf, action } <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">from</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'@kadira/storybook'</span>;\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">import</span> Button <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">from</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'./Button'</span>;\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">import</span> { WithNotes } <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">from</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'../notes-addon'</span>;\\n\\nstoriesOf(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'Button'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">module</span>)\\n  .add(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'with text'</span>, () =&gt; (\\n    <span class=\\\"xml\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">WithNotes</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">notes</span>=<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">{</span>'<span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">This</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">is</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">a</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">very</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">simple</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">Button</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">and</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">you</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">can</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">click</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">on</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">it.</span>'}&gt;</span>\\n      <span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">Button</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">onClick</span>=<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">{action(</span>'<span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">clicked</span>')}&gt;</span>Hello Button<span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;/<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">Button</span>&gt;</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;/<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">WithNotes</span>&gt;</span></span>\\n  ))\\n  .add(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'with some emoji'</span>, () =&gt; (\\n    <span class=\\\"xml\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">WithNotes</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">notes</span>=<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">{</span>'<span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">Here</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">we</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">use</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">some</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">emoji</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">as</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">the</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">Button</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">text.</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">Isn</span>\\\\'<span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">t</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">it</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">look</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">nice</span>?'}&gt;</span>\\n      <span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">Button</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">onClick</span>=<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">{action(</span>'<span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">clicked</span>')}&gt;</span>😀 😎 👍 💯<span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;/<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">Button</span>&gt;</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;/<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">WithNotes</span>&gt;</span></span>\\n  ));\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Then it will appear in the Notes panel like this:</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"../static/stories-with-notes.png\\\" alt=\\\"With notes\\\"></p>\\n<h2>Setup</h2>\\n<p>First, create an <code>addons.js</code> inside the Storybook config directory and add the following content to it.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-js\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// Storybook's default addons</span>\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">import</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'@kadira/storybook/addons'</span>;\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>We’ll use this file shortly to register the Notes addon we are building.</p>\\n<p>Now we need to create two files, <code>register.js</code> and <code>index.js,</code> inside a directory called <code>src/notes-addon</code>.</p>\\n<h2>The Addon</h2>\\n<p>Let’s add the following content to the <code>index.js</code>. It will expose a class called <code>WithNotes</code>, which wraps our story.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-js\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">import</span> React <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">from</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'react'</span>;\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">import</span> addons <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">from</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'@kadira/storybook-addons'</span>;\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">export</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-class\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">class</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-title\\\">WithNotes</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">extends</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-title\\\">React</span>.<span class=\\\"hljs-title\\\">Component</span> </span>{\\n  render() {\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">const</span> { children, notes } = <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">this</span>.props;\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">const</span> channel = addons.getChannel();\\n\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// send the notes to the channel.</span>\\n    channel.emit(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'kadira/notes/add_notes'</span>, notes);\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// return children elements.</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> children;\\n  }\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>In this case, our component can access something called the channel. It lets us communicate with the panel (where we display notes). It has a NodeJS <a href=\\\"https://nodejs.org/api/events.html\\\">EventEmitter</a> compatible API.</p>\\n<p>In the above case, it will emit the notes text to the channel, so our panel can listen to it.</p>\\n<p>Then add the following code to the register.js.</p>\\n<p>See: <a href=\\\"https://gist.github.com/arunoda/fb3859840ff616cc5ea0fa3ef8e3f358\\\">https://gist.github.com/arunoda/fb3859840ff616cc5ea0fa3ef8e3f358</a></p>\\n<p>It will register our addon and add a panel. In this case, the panel represents a React component called <code>Notes</code>. That component has access to the channel and storybook api.</p>\\n<p>Then it will listen to the channel and render the notes text on the panel. Have a look at the above annotated code.</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>In this example, we are only sending messages from the Preview Area to the Manager App (our panel). But we can do it the other way around as well.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>It also listens to another event, called onStory, in the storybook API, which fires when the user selects a story. We use that event to clear the previous notes when selecting a story.</p>\\n<h3>Register the addon</h3>\\n<p>Now, finally, we need to register the addon by importing it to the <code>.storybook/addons.js</code> file.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-js\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// Storybook's default addons</span>\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">import</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'@kadira/storybook/addons'</span>;\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// Our addon</span>\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">import</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'../src/notes-addon/register'</span>;\\n</code></pre>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Above code runs in the Manager App but not in the preview area.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>That’s it.

Have a look at this <a href=\\\"https://github.com/storybooks/storybook/tree/master/packages/addon-notes/tree/version1\\\">repo</a>.</p>\\n<p>In addition to moving the above code to an NPM module, we’ve set <code>react</code> and <code>@kadira/storybook-addons</code> as peer dependencies.</p>\\n<h3>Local Development</h3>\\n<p>When you are developing your addon as a package, you can’t use <code>npm link</code> to add it your project. Instead add your package as a local dependency into your <code>package.json</code> as shown below:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-json\\\">{\\n  ...\\n  \\\"dependencies\\\": {\\n    \\\"@kadira/storybook-addon-notes\\\": \\\"file:///home/username/myrepo\\\"\\n  }\\n  ...\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<h3>Package Maintenance</h3>\\n<p>Your packaged Storybook addon needed to be written in ES5. If you are using ES6, then you need to transpile it.\\nIn that case, we recommend to use <a href=\\\"https://github.com/kadirahq/react-cdk\\\">React CDK</a> for that.</p>\\n\"}\n\n/***/ },\n/* 478 */\n/***/ function(module, exports) {\n\n\tmodule.exports = {\"title\":\"Modules used on this site\",\"body\":\"<p>A real documentation site would have live examples here.

This is pretty neat when you are manually testing your components.</p>\\n<p>Also, you can think of this as a way to document events in your components.</p>\\n<h2>Third Party Addons</h2>\\n<p>You need to install these addons directly from NPM in order to use them.</p>\\n<h3><a href=\\\"https://github.com/philcockfield/storybook-host\\\">Host</a></h3>\\n<p>A <a href=\\\"/docs/react-storybook/addons/introduction\\\">decorator</a> with\\npowerful display options for hosting, sizing and framing your components.</p>\\n<h3><a href=\\\"https://github.com/mthuret/storybook-addon-specifications\\\">Specs</a></h3>\\n<p>This is a very special addon where it’ll allow you to write test specs directly inside your stories.\\nYou can even run these tests inside a CI box.</p>\\n<h3><a href=\\\"https://github.com/storybooks/storybook/tree/master/packages/addon-knobs\\\">Knobs</a></h3>\\n<p>Knobs allow you to edit React props dynamically using the Storybook UI.\\nYou can also use Knobs as dynamic variables inside your stories.</p>\\n<h3><a href=\\\"https://github.com/storybooks/storybook/tree/master/packages/addon-notes\\\">Notes</a></h3>\\n<p>With this addon, you can write notes for each story in your component. This is pretty useful when you are working with a team.</p>\\n<h3><a href=\\\"https://github.com/storybooks/storybook/tree/master/packages/addon-info\\\">Info</a></h3>\\n<p>If you are using Storybook as a style guide, then this addon will help you to build a nice-looking style guide with docs, automatic sample source code with a PropType explorer.</p>\\n<h3><a href=\\\"https://github.com/storybooks/storybook/tree/master/packages/addon-options\\\">Options</a></h3>\\n<p>The Storybook webapp UI can be customised with this addon. It can be used to change the header, show/hide various UI elements and to enable full-screen mode by default.</p>\\n<h3><a href=\\\"https://github.com/yangshun/react-storybook-addon-chapters\\\">Chapters</a></h3>\\n<p>With this addon, you can showcase multiple components (or varying component states) within a story by breaking it down into smaller categories (chapters) and subcategories (sections) for more organizational goodness.</p>\\n<h3><a href=\\\"https://github.com/NewSpring/react-storybook-addon-backgrounds\\\">Backgrounds</a></h3>\\n<p>With this addon, you can switch between background colors and background images for your preview components. It is really helpful for styleguides.</p>\\n<h3><a href=\\\"https://github.com/sm-react/storybook-addon-material-ui\\\">Material-UI</a></h3>\\n<p>Wraps your story into MuiThemeProvider. It allows you to add your custom themes, switch between them, make changes in the visual editor and download as JSON file</p>\\n<h3><a href=\\\"https://github.com/tuchk4/storybook-readme\\\">README</a></h3>\\n<p>With this addon, you can add docs in markdown format for each story. It very useful because most projects and components already have <a href=\\\"http://README.md\\\">README.md</a> files.

You can find this in both the addon register code and in your addon’s wrapper component (where used inside a story).</p>\\n<p>It has a NodeJS <a href=\\\"https://nodejs.org/api/events.html\\\">EventEmitter</a> compatible API. So, you can use it to emit events and listen for events.</p>\\n<h3>addonAPI.register()</h3>\\n<p>This method allows you to register an addon and get the storybook API. You can do this only in the Manager App.\\nSee how we can use this:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-js\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// Register the addon with a unique name.</span>\\naddonAPI.register(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'kadira/notes'</span>, (storybookAPI) =&gt; {\\n\\n});\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Now you’ll get an instance to our StorybookAPI. See the <a href=\\\"/docs/react-storybook/addons/api#storybook-api\\\">api docs</a> for Storybook API regarding using that.</p>\\n<h3>addonAPI.addPanel()</h3>\\n<p>This method allows you to add a panel to Storybook.

It’s a Notes addon on which you can display some notes for a story.</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Just for the simplicity, we’ll write the addon right inside our app. But we can easily move it into a separate NPM module.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<h2>How it looks</h2>\\n<p>We write a story for our addon like this:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-js\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">import</span> React <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">from</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'react'</span>;\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">import</span> { storiesOf, action } <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">from</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'@kadira/storybook'</span>;\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">import</span> Button <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">from</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'./Button'</span>;\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">import</span> { WithNotes } <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">from</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'../notes-addon'</span>;\\n\\nstoriesOf(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'Button'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">module</span>)\\n  .add(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'with text'</span>, () =&gt; (\\n    <span class=\\\"xml\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">WithNotes</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">notes</span>=<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">{</span>'<span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">This</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">is</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">a</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">very</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">simple</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">Button</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">and</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">you</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">can</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">click</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">on</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">it.</span>'}&gt;</span>\\n      <span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">Button</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">onClick</span>=<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">{action(</span>'<span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">clicked</span>')}&gt;</span>Hello Button<span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;/<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">Button</span>&gt;</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;/<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">WithNotes</span>&gt;</span></span>\\n  ))\\n  .add(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'with some emoji'</span>, () =&gt; (\\n    <span class=\\\"xml\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">WithNotes</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">notes</span>=<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">{</span>'<span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">Here</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">we</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">use</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">some</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">emoji</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">as</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">the</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">Button</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">text.</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">Isn</span>\\\\'<span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">t</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">it</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">look</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">nice</span>?'}&gt;</span>\\n      <span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">Button</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">onClick</span>=<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">{action(</span>'<span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">clicked</span>')}&gt;</span>😀 😎 👍 💯<span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;/<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">Button</span>&gt;</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;/<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">WithNotes</span>&gt;</span></span>\\n  ));\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Then it will appear in the Notes panel like this:</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"../static/stories-with-notes.png\\\" alt=\\\"With notes\\\"></p>\\n<h2>Setup</h2>\\n<p>First, create an <code>addons.js</code> inside the Storybook config directory and add the following content to it.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-js\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// Storybook's default addons</span>\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">import</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'@kadira/storybook/addons'</span>;\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>We’ll use this file shortly to register the Notes addon we are building.</p>\\n<p>Now we need to create two files, <code>register.js</code> and <code>index.js,</code> inside a directory called <code>src/notes-addon</code>.</p>\\n<h2>The Addon</h2>\\n<p>Let’s add the following content to the <code>index.js</code>. It will expose a class called <code>WithNotes</code>, which wraps our story.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-js\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">import</span> React <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">from</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'react'</span>;\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">import</span> addons <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">from</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'@kadira/storybook-addons'</span>;\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">export</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-class\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">class</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-title\\\">WithNotes</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">extends</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-title\\\">React</span>.<span class=\\\"hljs-title\\\">Component</span> </span>{\\n  render() {\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">const</span> { children, notes } = <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">this</span>.props;\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">const</span> channel = addons.getChannel();\\n\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// send the notes to the channel.</span>\\n    channel.emit(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'kadira/notes/add_notes'</span>, notes);\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// return children elements.</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> children;\\n  }\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>In this case, our component can access something called the channel. It lets us communicate with the panel (where we display notes). It has a NodeJS <a href=\\\"https://nodejs.org/api/events.html\\\">EventEmitter</a> compatible API.</p>\\n<p>In the above case, it will emit the notes text to the channel, so our panel can listen to it.</p>\\n<p>Then add the following code to the register.js.</p>\\n<p>See: <a href=\\\"https://gist.github.com/arunoda/fb3859840ff616cc5ea0fa3ef8e3f358\\\">https://gist.github.com/arunoda/fb3859840ff616cc5ea0fa3ef8e3f358</a></p>\\n<p>It will register our addon and add a panel. In this case, the panel represents a React component called <code>Notes</code>. That component has access to the channel and storybook api.</p>\\n<p>Then it will listen to the channel and render the notes text on the panel. Have a look at the above annotated code.</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>In this example, we are only sending messages from the Preview Area to the Manager App (our panel). But we can do it the other way around as well.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>It also listens to another event, called onStory, in the storybook API, which fires when the user selects a story. We use that event to clear the previous notes when selecting a story.</p>\\n<h3>Register the addon</h3>\\n<p>Now, finally, we need to register the addon by importing it to the <code>.storybook/addons.js</code> file.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-js\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// Storybook's default addons</span>\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">import</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'@kadira/storybook/addons'</span>;\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// Our addon</span>\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">import</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'../src/notes-addon/register'</span>;\\n</code></pre>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Above code runs in the Manager App but not in the preview area.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>That’s it.

Have a look at this <a href=\\\"https://github.com/storybooks/storybook/tree/master/packages/addon-notes/tree/version1\\\">repo</a>.</p>\\n<p>In addition to moving the above code to an NPM module, we’ve set <code>react</code> and <code>@kadira/storybook-addons</code> as peer dependencies.</p>\\n<h3>Local Development</h3>\\n<p>When you are developing your addon as a package, you can’t use <code>npm link</code> to add it your project. Instead add your package as a local dependency into your <code>package.json</code> as shown below:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-json\\\">{\\n  ...\\n  \\\"dependencies\\\": {\\n    \\\"@kadira/storybook-addon-notes\\\": \\\"file:///home/username/myrepo\\\"\\n  }\\n  ...\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<h3>Package Maintenance</h3>\\n<p>Your packaged Storybook addon needed to be written in ES5. If you are using ES6, then you need to transpile it.\\nIn that case, we recommend to use <a href=\\\"https://github.com/kadirahq/react-cdk\\\">React CDK</a> for that.</p>\\n\"}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./docs/react-storybook/addons/writing-addons.md\n// module id = 477\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = {\"title\":\"Modules used on this site\",\"body\":\"<p>A real documentation site would have live examples here.
