React Storybook is a UI development environment for your React components. With it, you can visualize different states of your UI components and develop them interactively.

We recently switched repo-strategy, this readme needs editing.

## Intro
React Storybook runs outside of your app. So you can develop UI components in isolation without worrying about app specific dependencies and requirements.
