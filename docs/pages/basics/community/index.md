Storybook is maintained by a [community of users](https://github.com/storybooks/storybook/graphs/contributors). It's easy to get involved and all contributions are welcome!

You can read about how to get involved in detail in our [Contribution Guide](https://github.com/storybooks/storybook/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) but at a high level, a good place to get started is:

1.  Report issues at the [issue tracker](https://github.com/storybooks/storybook/issues).
2.  Help us to triage issues above, by answering questions, helping to create [reproductions](https://github.com/storybooks/storybook/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#reproductions), and clarifying feature requests.
3.  Pitch in with a PR, especially those marked ["good first contribution"](https://github.com/storybooks/storybook/labels/good%20first%20contribution).
