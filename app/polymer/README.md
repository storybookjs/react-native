# Storybook for Polymer

Storybook for polymer is a UI development environment for your Polymer components.
With it, you can visualize different states of your UI components and develop them interactively.

> Storybook for Polymer is at the **EXPERIMENTAL** stage!

Storybook runs outside of your app.
So you can develop UI components in isolation without worrying about app specific dependencies and requirements.

## Getting Started

```sh
cd my-polymer-app
npx -p @storybook/cli@rc sb init
```

Storybook also comes with a lot of [addons](https://storybook.js.org/addons/introduction) and a great API to customize as you wish.
You can also build a [static version](https://storybook.js.org/basics/exporting-storybook) of your storybook and deploy it anywhere you want.
